                <h2>Welcome!</h2>
                <p>If you're here, that is probably because I applied for a position at your company. I really cannot begin to thank you enough for taking the time to check out my website and, by extension, getting to know a little bit more of me in the process.</p>
                <p>My name is Andrew. I am 23 years old and I'm a self-taught programmer. Ever since I was a kid, I've always been in love with video games, modding, tech, and design. I've worked as a hardware & software repair technician for five years now and over two years ago, I began my coding journey. What have I learned, you may ask?</p>

                <h2>Well, professionally speaking...</h2>
                <p>I have a strong, yet always improving core understanding of HTML/HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, Java, Python, C++, and C#. Great knowledge of frameworks(React, Vue, Node, etc) and APIs(REST). I can also work with Cloud infrastructures(AWS), databases(MySQL), test driven development(Git), object oriented programming, web design(HTML, CSS, WordPress), and any operating systems. I am able to excel in either front end or back end positions. If I do not know something, I WILL learn it, and I will make sure I learn it fast.</p>
                <p>Besides technical qualifications, I pride myself in my consistency and ability to stay level headed no matter what. I'm always ready to give it my 101%. Every day I strive to learn new information, new functions, or new ways to optimize. I am self-sufficient and resourceful, yet not afraid to ask for help when I cannot seem to find the answers. Obsessed with knowledge and self-improvement. I approach bugs and struggles as a chance to learn something new and hone my abilities.</p> 
                <p>I am very communicative and always look forward to feedback so I can know what to work on. Due to the nature of my work for the last five years, I've also come to excel at narrowing down problems and fixing them. Combined with my programming skills, I truly believe I am very capable of becoming crucial to your team.</p>

                <h2>Personally speaking?</h2>
                <p>I am looking for a team of like-minded coworkers, and perhaps someday, friends I can share my passion and desire to learn together with. I love to have fun, and my enjoyment for programming has only gotten ever stronger throughout the years. Even outside of work, I am stuck to my computer either gaming, modding, watching tech news, or practicing coding. Learning to code has become one of the most addictive feelings in my life, and getting a job here would allow me to build a network of people I can relate with and become an amazing team with. I am even in several programming communities where I help can help others as much as they help me.</p> 
                <p>I am the kind of person that refuses to disappoint either his friends or coworkers, and is always looking to be on par if not better than others. Not out of a competitive nature, but of a desire to become someone that can help others in their struggles. I am always studying and improving, even off the clock. Solving problems has been one of my strongest abilities throughout my career, so coding has been very smooth and satisfying for me to work with.</p> 
                <p>My whole life has been building up to this moment where I finally take a leap into my coding career, and I wholeheartedly hope you can be one of the first people to reach out to me so we can work together. I genuinely believe that if you give me a chance, I will become a great asset to your team very quickly. Not just as an employee, but as someone you can count on and look forward to working with every day. Thank you for reading my website, and please, don't hesitate to contact me!</p>
